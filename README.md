## APP DESCRIPTION

**FILREEL is the big brother of my second app, Popcorn. In FILMBIT users can see movie info and add movies to their watch list, users can also add friends and see what movies each friend is currently interested in watching. 

FILMBIT was built using React and Firestore. **



## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript
- [x] React
- [x] Firestore
- [x] theMovieDB API


## GETTING STARTED

Log in or register to see movies that you can review!


## NEXT STEPS

 
 
#### UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

- [ ] Users select the same friend more than once
- [ ] Search bar goes into an infinite loop if it cannot find any results
- [ ] User cannot see their own card
- [ ] Users cannot Edit user information

#### FUTURE PLANS

- [ ] Edit User Information
- [ ] Using the calendar component, add an API and list current movies in theaters by titles, dates and location.
      Users can select the date and add themselves to the list and other users will get an alert saying someone is intrested in viewing the same movie. Users would also be able to invite friends. Add message/comment section where users can post where to meet up if interested in watching that movie.
- [ ] Select an actor and see what movies they have been in
- [ ] Movie previews for popular movies
- [ ] What streaming service the movie is playing in, if any
- [ ] Sort/Filter movies by genre
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] User Lists where users can add lists of movies
- [ ] Comments

 
## SUMMARY
For my capstone project, I wanted to continue my second project(Popcorn) and add more features. For FILMREEL, I wanted to add the ability for users to add movies and friends to their user profile. Users could also view their friends and see what movies they were watching and see their friends friends.

My initial step was to wire frame and make a list of what components I needed and which pages should be linked. I quickly learned that like coding, you have to take it one step at a time and understand what your MVP is and what steps you need to take to get there.

I started out linking the movieDB and rendering the movie posters in a grid and having a movie show page for each movie.

The next step was learning how to implement user collections, sub-collections and auth with Firestore. Luckily, Mike our local instructor was an excellent resource for guidance and technical questions.

The most difficult aspects of this project was how quickly React started to get more complex and keeping up with which component props were being passed into. It was also difficult, learning how to implement Firestore as a backend and linking the data with so many moving parts.

In summary, this project really helped deepen my understand of React components and props while having to learn Firestore as a backend.

I wouldn't have been able to complete this project as successfully as I did, without the help of my cohort and my instructors and for that I cannot thank them enough!
