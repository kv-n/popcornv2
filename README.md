## SUMMARY
For my capstone project, I wanted to continue my second project(Popcorn) and add more features. For FILMBIT, I wanted to add the ability for users to add movies and friends to their user profile. Users could also view their friends and see what movies they were watching and see their friends.

Initial step was to wire frame and see what components I needed and what pages linked to what.

I started out linking the movieDB and rendering the movie posters in a grid.

The next step was learning how to implement user collections, sub-collections and auth with Firestore. Luckily, Mike our local instructor was an excellent resource for guidance.

The most difficult aspects of this project was how quickly React started to get more complex and learning how to implement Firestore as a backend and linking the data with so many different React components. 

In summary, this project really helped me understand React components and props while having to learn Firestore as a backend. 

I wouldn't have been able to complete this project successfully as I did, without the help of my cohort and my instructors!
